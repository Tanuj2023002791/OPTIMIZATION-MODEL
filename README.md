## DESCRIPTION


# ðŸ“Š Linear Programming Optimization using PuLP

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project tackles a business optimization problem using Linear Programming (LP) with the help of Pythonâ€™s PuLP library. The aim is to identify the ideal number of units to produce for Product A and Product B in order to maximize profit, while working within limited labor hours and material availability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Problem Statement

A company is engaged in producing two different products: A and B.
Each of these products requires a certain amount of labor time and material input to manufacture, and each generates a specific profit per unit.

The objective is to maximize the companyâ€™s profit, without exceeding the available labor and material resources.

## âœ… Key Features

- Accepts user-defined inputs for:
  - Per-unit profit of both products
  - Labor and material usage per unit
  - Total available labor hours and material units
- Builds and solves a linear programming model
- Delivers:
  - The best production strategy for both products
  - The maximum possible profit
  - Solution status and practical business insights

### OUTPUT:
