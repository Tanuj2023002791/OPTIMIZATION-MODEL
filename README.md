## DESCRIPTION


# 📊 Linear Programming Optimization using PuLP

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project tackles a business optimization problem using Linear Programming (LP) with the help of Python’s PuLP library. The aim is to identify the ideal number of units to produce for Product A and Product B in order to maximize profit, while working within limited labor hours and material availability.

## 🎯 Business Problem Statement

A company is engaged in producing two different products: A and B.
Each of these products requires a certain amount of labor time and material input to manufacture, and each generates a specific profit per unit.

The objective is to maximize the company’s profit, without exceeding the available labor and material resources.

## ✅ Key Features

- Accepts user-defined inputs for:
  - Per-unit profit of both products
  - Labor and material usage per unit
  - Total available labor hours and material units
- Builds and solves a linear programming model
- Delivers:
  - The best production strategy for both products
  - The maximum possible profit
  - Solution status and practical business insights

## 🏗️ Code Structure

```python
1. Import PuLP
2. Describe the business problem
3. Take user inputs for profits and constraints
4. Define the LP problem using PuLP
5. Set decision variables (units of A & B)
6. Set the objective function (maximize profit)
7. Add labor and material constraints
8. Solve the LP problem
9. Display results and production strategy
10. Provide business insight based on results
